# Hand Gesture Recognition using OpenCV

This repository contains Python code for real-time hand gesture recognition using OpenCV. The system detects hand gestures from a live video stream captured by a webcam and counts the number of fingers displayed by the hand.

## Features

- Real-time hand gesture recognition.
- Counting the number of fingers displayed by the hand.
- Supports different hand poses and lighting conditions.
- Simple and intuitive user interface.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- scikit-learn (for finger counting)

You can install the required dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy scikit-learn
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
https://github.com/Aditya168-coder/hand_gesture_recognition_using_openCV.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd hand_gesture_recognition_using_openCV
```

3. Run the Python script:

```bash
python hand_gesture_recognition_main.py
```

4. Place your hand within the region of interest (ROI) displayed in the video stream. The system will detect and count the number of fingers displayed by your hand in real-time.
